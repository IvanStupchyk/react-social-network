# About The Project

This is a SPA written with class components. 
This is a small social network where you can add and edit user data. It is also possible to see who is registered in this network.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick Start

1. In bash/terminal/command line, cd into your project directory.
2. Run `yarn` to install required files.
3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
* `yarn start` Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser;
* `yarn test` Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
* `yarn build` lints your JavaScript using eslint. Rules can be found in the `.eslintrc` config file.
